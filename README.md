CodingBat is a free site of live coding problems to build coding skill in Java and Python (example problem). CodingBat is a project by Nick Parlante, 
a computer science lecturer at Stanford. Going through many practice problem is a great way to solidify your understanding of how the code should work.

# Did i have change my usual programming language ?
     My usual programming language : C#
     you may find, that codingbat.com uses only to specific language to give solution.
     But I am not learing a new langauge for that, rather intially I used to code in C# that too 
     not using any inbuilt fucntion in that language, then i convert to java language.
